    <title>European Union Emissions Trading System</title>
    <body>
        <p>The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is a "cap and trade" scheme where a
            limit is placed on the right to emit specified pollutants over an area and companies can
            trade emission rights within that area. It covers around 45% of the EUs greenhouse gas
                    emissions.<sup><xref

                Allowances</xref> for emissions are then auctioned off or allocated for free, and
            can subsequently be traded.  Installations must <xref

                scope="external">monitor</xref> and report their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, ensuring
            they hand in enough allowances to the authorities to cover their emissions. If emission
            exceeds what is permitted by its allowances, an installation must purchase allowances
            from others. Conversely, if an installation has performed well at reducing its
            emissions, it can sell its leftover credits.</p>
        <p>Under the "cap and trade" principle, a maximum (cap) is set on the total amount of
            greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The scheme has been divided into a number of "trading periods" as follows:</p>

            <p>In the first phase, the EU ETS included some 12,000 installations, representing

            <p>On 27 April 2012, the European Commission announced the full activation of the EU

                migration of over 30,000 EU ETS accounts from national registries. The European
                Commission further stated that the single registry to be activated in June will not
